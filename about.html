          <h1 itemprop="name">Meet Sam Pecor</h1>
          <p class="about__lede" itemprop="description">
            A lifelong Mainer and now a Ward 7 homeowner, Sam has watched Southern Maine change fast—and Biddeford is no exception. Since entering real estate in 2019, he’s had a front-row seat to the dramatic shifts in housing affordability as our communities grow at a pace
            not seen in decades.</p>
          <p class="about__lede" itemprop="description">
            Living in and managing a small multifamily in Biddeford has taught him the value of clear communication, disciplined budgeting, and prioritizing essentials. These practical, on-the-ground perspectives are needed in city government. He’s running
            for City Council to fix what’s broken, grow smart, and own the results—by maintaining streets and sewers, supporting small-scale multifamily housing that fits our neighborhoods, attracting “right-fit” business growth, and ensuring Ward 7 residents are in the room
            when decisions are made.
          </p>

          <h3>Why I’m running</h3>
          <p>
            City government isn’t a business, and it isn’t a nonprofit either—our revenue and expenses must make sense and put taxpayers first. To get there, we need a City Council that is transparent, responsive, and practical. Deferred maintenance and rising costs have squeezed
            Ward 7 homeowners and renters alike—too often the result of blame-shifting and kicking the can down the road. Sam will refocus on the basics: finish mandated sewer and street work wisely; set comprehensive maintenance schedules and budget for them; and publish
            progress snapshots so you can see results in real time. His goal is to stretch every taxpayer dollar, pursue outside funding and investment, and limit new debt so we invest more in maintaining what we have instead of paying interest. He also wants housing rules to be
            clear and predictable, favoring small-scale rehab and infill that fit our neighborhoods—and ensuring no one is priced out.
          </p>

        <h2>Sam’s story</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Scarborough and have spent my whole life in Southern Maine. I’ve hauled trash, done tree work, worked service and sales jobs, learned the trades, and now work professionally as a real estate agent—giving me a view from all sides of our most pressing issues. In 2021, I bought a four-unit apartment building in Biddeford. Since then, I’ve tried to be a good steward of the property and treat my tenants as neighbors, not numbers. Along the way I’ve driven rideshare and delivery, sat at kitchen tables talking zoning and taxes, and fallen in love with policy and history. It’s a patchwork of experiences, with a few common threads: curiosity for everything, attentive listening, a love of learning, and a focus on problem-solving.</p>
        <p>In conversations on doorsteps, at City Hall, and with the thousands of riders in and out of my back seat, I hear it clearly: tenants facing steep renewals; parents pushing for stronger schools, traffic calming, and safe crossings; and retirees anxious about higher taxes. I’m running to focus on the essentials, invest where it counts, and ensure every voice is heard.</p>
