          <p class="about__lede" itemprop="description">
            Raised in Southern Maine and now a Ward 7 homeowner, Sam has worn many hats—from carpenter and painter to rideshare driver and real estate agent. Living and managing a small multifamily in Biddeford has taught him the value of clear rules, predictable costs,
            and a government that works for everyone. He’s running for City Council to fix what’s broken, grow smart, and own the results by maintaining streets and sewers, supporting small‑scale housing that fits our neighborhoods, and ensuring Ward 7 residents are always
            in the room when decisions are made.
          </p>

          <h3>Why I’m running</h3>
          <p>
            I’m running because our city government should work like the best kind of neighbor: transparent, responsive, and practical. Deferred maintenance and rising costs have squeezed Ward 7 homeowners and renters alike. I want to refocus on the basics—finish mandated
            sewer and street work wisely, establish a maintenance line in the budget, and publish progress snapshots so you can see results. My goal is to stretch every taxpayer dollar, pursue outside funding, and limit new debt so we invest more in maintaining what we have
            instead of paying interest. I also want to make housing rules clear and predictable, favoring small‑scale rehab and infill that fit our neighborhoods, and ensuring no one is priced out.
          </p>

          <h3>Background &amp; experience</h3>

        <h2>Sam’s story</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Scarborough and have spent my adult life here in Southern Maine. I started out in the trades—scraping paint, hanging drywall, and learning enough plumbing and wiring to be dangerous. Eventually I turned that know‑how into a career in real estate, helping neighbors buy, sell, and renovate homes while I fixed up my own four‑unit property. Along the way I’ve driven rideshare and delivery, sat at countless kitchen tables talking about zoning and taxes, and fallen in love with policy and history. It’s been a patchwork of experiences, but the common thread has always been listening and problem‑solving.</p>
        <p>Those experiences and the stories people shared with me—renters worried about rent hikes, parents frustrated by potholes, seniors anxious about taxes—inspire me to run. A neighbor once called me over because a contractor told her to replace an entire drain line for thousands of dollars. Together we traced the problem to a simple clog and fixed it for the cost of a pair of gloves. That kind of practical, no‑nonsense approach is what I want to bring to City Hall: fix what’s broken, invest wisely, and make sure every resident has a voice.</p>
