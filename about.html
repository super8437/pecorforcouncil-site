          <p class="about__lede" itemprop="description">
            A lifelong Mainer and now a Ward 7 homeowner, Sam has watched Southern Maine change fast—and Biddeford is no exception. Since entering real estate in 2019, he’s had a front-row seat to the dramatic shifts in housing affordability as our communities grow at a pace
            not seen in decades. Living in and managing a small multifamily in Biddeford has taught him the value of clear communication, disciplined budgeting, and prioritizing essentials. These practical, on-the-ground perspectives are needed in city government. He’s running
            for City Council to fix what’s broken, grow smart, and own the results—by maintaining streets and sewers, supporting small-scale multifamily housing that fits our neighborhoods, attracting “right-fit” business growth, and ensuring Ward 7 residents are in the room
            when decisions are made.
          </p>

          <h3>Why I’m running</h3>
          <p>
            City government isn’t a business, and it isn’t a nonprofit either—our revenue and expenses must make sense and put taxpayers first. To get there, we need a City Council that is transparent, responsive, and practical. Deferred maintenance and rising costs have squeezed
            Ward 7 homeowners and renters alike—too often the result of blame-shifting and kicking the can down the road. Sam will refocus on the basics: finish mandated sewer and street work wisely; set comprehensive maintenance schedules and budget for them; and publish
            progress snapshots so you can see results in real time. His goal is to stretch every taxpayer dollar, pursue outside funding and investment, and limit new debt so we invest more in maintaining what we have instead of paying interest. He also wants housing rules to be
            clear and predictable, favoring small-scale rehab and infill that fit our neighborhoods—and ensuring no one is priced out.
          </p>

        <h2>Sam’s story</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Scarborough and have spent my adult life here in Southern Maine. I started out in the trades—scraping paint, hanging drywall, and learning enough plumbing and wiring to be dangerous. Eventually I turned that know‑how into a career in real estate, helping neighbors buy, sell, and renovate homes while I fixed up my own four‑unit property. Along the way I’ve driven rideshare and delivery, sat at countless kitchen tables talking about zoning and taxes, and fallen in love with policy and history. It’s been a patchwork of experiences, but the common thread has always been listening and problem‑solving.</p>
        <p>Those experiences and the stories people shared with me—renters worried about rent hikes, parents frustrated by potholes, seniors anxious about taxes—inspire me to run. A neighbor once called me over because a contractor told her to replace an entire drain line for thousands of dollars. Together we traced the problem to a simple clog and fixed it for the cost of a pair of gloves. That kind of practical, no‑nonsense approach is what I want to bring to City Hall: fix what’s broken, invest wisely, and make sure every resident has a voice.</p>
